# Visual Projects

Welcome to the Visual Coding Challenges repository! This repository contains a collection of visually appealing coding challenges implemented using the Processing library. Each challenge explores different concepts and techniques related to computer graphics and simulations.

## Challenges

Each of the directories is a different coding challenge.

## Usage

To run any of the challenges, you will need to have the Processing library installed. You can download and install Processing from the official website: [https://processing.org](https://processing.org)

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/visual-coding-challenges.git
   ```

2. Open the Processing IDE and navigate to the location where you cloned the repository.

3. Explore the challenge folders and open the `.pde` files corresponding to the challenge you want to run.

4. Click the "Run" button in the Processing IDE or press `Ctrl + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + R` (Mac) to execute the code.

5. Enjoy the visual simulations and interact with them if applicable (e.g., mouse or keyboard input).

## Acknowledgments

The challenges in this repository are inspired by various computer graphics techniques, simulations, and mathematical concepts. The challenges are inspired by Daniel Shiffam's coding challenges.
